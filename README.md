## Comparing Sampling Techniques 

This project compares different sampling techniques for creating a balanced dataset for a machine learning model. The dataset used is initially unbalanced, so appropriate over-sampling techniques are used to create a balanced dataset. Five different sampling techniques are then applied to the balanced dataset, and each sample is trained with about 20 different packages using pycaret and their accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score are compared.
